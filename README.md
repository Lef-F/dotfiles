It's a happy world when you spin up a new computer/device/potato and within a few minutes you have your familiar old setup already configured!

That's at least what this repo will attempt to do for me.
And who knows, maybe for you too? 🤷‍♂️

Have an awesome day! 🥳

## Known Issues 😅

### powerlevel10k does not work by default on Visual Studio Code
